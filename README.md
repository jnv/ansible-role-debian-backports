# Debian/Ubuntu Backports with Ansible

[![Ansible Role: jnv.debian-backports](https://img.shields.io/ansible/role/224.svg)](https://galaxy.ansible.com/jnv/debian-backports)
[![Build Status](https://github.com/jnv/ansible-role-debian-backports/workflows/Integration/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/jnv/ansible-role-debian-backports/actions?query=workflow%3AIntegration)

Adds backports repository for Debian and Ubuntu.

**Note for Debian users:** Debian provides backports [only for the latest stable version](https://backports.debian.org/news/stretch-backports/).

## Breaking Changes

Version 1.0.0 of this role introduced potentially breaking changes for older systems. See [MIGRATING.md](MIGRATING.md) for details.

## Project Status

[![Repo status: Inactive](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/inactive.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#inactive)

The role has reached a stable, usable state but is no longer being actively developed. Support and maintenance will be provided as time allows, primarily to keep the role working under newer versions of Debian, Ubuntu, and Ansible.

If you wish to add new features, feel free to fork the project. Also [let me know](https://github.com/jnv/ansible-role-debian-backports/issues/13) about your role, I might list it in [Similar Roles](#similar-roles) section.

## Usage

Install via [Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/):

```
ansible-galaxy install jnv.debian-backports
```

In your playbook:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  roles:
    # ...
    - jnv.debian-backports
```

The role uses [apt_repository module](http://docs.ansible.com/apt_repository_module.html) which has additional requirements.

You can use `default_release` option for [apt module](http://docs.ansible.com/apt_module.html) to install package from backports. For example:

```yaml
tasks:
  - apt: name=mosh state=present default_release={{ansible_distribution_release}}-backports
```

`ansible_distribution_release` variable contains release name, i.e. `precise` or `wheezy`.

## Variables

- `backports_uri`: URI of the backports repository; change this if you want to use a particular mirror.
  - Debian: `http://deb.debian.org/debian`
  - Ubuntu: `http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu`
- `backports_components`: Release and components for sources.list
  - Debian: `{{backports_distribution}}-backports backports main contrib non-free`
  - Ubuntu: `{{backports_distribution}}-backports main restricted universe multiverse`
- `backports_state`: Whether the backports repository should be used; default `'present'`, change to `'absent'` to disable the role.
- `backports_priority_enabled`: Whether to enable backports priority (APT pinning); default `false`.
- `backports_priority`: Set pin priority for the backports repository; default `100`. See more at [`AptConfiguration` page](https://wiki.debian.org/AptConfiguration).

## Similar Roles

- [jgeusebroek.backports](https://galaxy.ansible.com/jgeusebroek/backports)
- [oefenweb.apt](https://galaxy.ansible.com/oefenweb/apt) â€“ does much more, but can be also used to enable backports.

## Testing

For developing and testing this role Github Actions, Molecule and Vagrant is used.
In a local environment environment you can easily test the role with

```
pip3 install molecule-vagrant ansible-lint yamllint
molecule test
```

This requires [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) to be installed.
